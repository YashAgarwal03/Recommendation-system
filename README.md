# Recommendation System Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a **Hybrid Recommendation System** that combines **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** to provide personalized recommendations for e-commerce users. The pipeline is modular, efficient, and ready for deployment, making it suitable for real-world applications.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - Extracts relevant features from product descriptions and metadata.
  - Utilizes **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to recommend products based on similarity to user preferences.

- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - Leverages a **user-item-rating matrix** to recommend products by analyzing user interactions.
  - Uses **Cosine Similarity** to find users with similar preferences and recommend items based on those shared interests.

- **Hybrid Approach**:
  - Combines the strengths of **content-based** and **collaborative filtering**.
  - Ensures robust recommendations even when limited user interaction data is available (cold-start problem).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a hybrid recommendation system that enhances user experience in e-commerce platforms. The system aims to:

1. Suggest relevant products based on user preferences and browsing history.
2. Handle sparse user interaction data effectively.
3. Provide a scalable, modular, and easily deployable solution.

### Key Highlights:
- Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline for categorical and missing values.
- Feature engineering to merge multiple data attributes into a single content column.
- Seamless integration of **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** methodologies.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Processing: Pandas.Numpy
  - Natural Language Processing: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer)
  - Similarity Calculations: Scipy (Cosine Similarity)

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values 
- Merge multiple product-related features (e.g., product_name, category, review) into a single content feature.

### 2. Content-Based Filtering
- Apply **TF-IDF Vectorization** on the content feature.
- Compute **Cosine Similarity** to identify and recommend similar items.

### 3. Collaborative Filtering
- Build a **user-item-rating matrix**.
- Calculate user and item similarity using **Cosine Similarity**.
- Recommend products based on user interaction data and similar users' preferences.

### 4. Hybrid Recommendation
- Combine results from **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** approaches.
- Generate final recommendations using a weighted blend of both methods.
